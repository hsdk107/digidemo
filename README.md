# Writing for the Web: Demo Site using the Minimal Mistakes starter setup

Demo site built using [**this template**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) to get up and running with minimal effort. Refer to [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) for a more elaborate setup.

The basic configuration comes with:
- Sample posts.
- Sample top navigation.
- Sample author sidebar with social links.
- Sample footer links.
- Paginated home page.
- Archive pages for posts grouped by year, category, and tag.
- Sample about page.
- Sample 404 page.
- Site wide search.

You have already replaced the sample content with your own for previous assignments, with the option to [configure as necessary](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).
